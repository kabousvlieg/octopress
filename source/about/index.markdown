Hi, I am [Kobus](za.linkedin.com/in/kobusengineer). I am a software architect serving in a team of roughly 10 engineers, developing cryptography related embedded products.

This blog serves to capture my thoughts about embedded technologies, software development practices and interesting problems in the software engineering field.

This blog will also serve as a sounding board for my thesis titled "Applying agile best practices to DO-178 and similar software development methodologies"

Why did I title this blog "Embedded fool"? Partly because I will be fooling around with various ideas and concepts on this blog, and partly to remind myself that many times I am wrong and foolish, and should not hold on to the stated opinions on this blog too tightly.

You can contact me at kobusengineer at google dot com if you have any questions.
